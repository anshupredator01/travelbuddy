# Travel Buddy
To create an android application for tourists that offers services. A tourist requires contemporary technology that can serve them. Therefore, the Android app should be simple to use and effective at managing travel-related activities. The lack of such an application is causing problems for tourists visiting London. To obtain information, they must pay local guides and agents a sizeable portion of their travel budget.
There is no appropriate tourist guide that can locate the user, determine distance, and provide appropriate guide lines using polylines. Traveling to a popular tourist destination like London can present a number of challenges that can be solved by creating a system that provides precise global positioning system (GPS) coordinates, appropriate real-time directions, and textual and visual information about the location.
